        <p class="first"><b>As you stand before your birthday cake, the flames of the candles flickering in the breeze, each wish you make represents a promise of hope and dreams for the future. These wishes are not mere fleeting desires; they are profound affirmations of your aspirations and aspirations that carry with them the power to shape the world around you. As you make these wishes, let them take flight on the wings of hope and possibility. May they soar high above, ready to turn into reality as you continue to grow and evolve. We wish for you an abundance of success in all your endeavors, good health that keeps you strong and vibrant, and every happiness that the world has to offer. May the universe conspire to make each one of your dreams a reality, Apoorva, for you deserve nothing less.</b>

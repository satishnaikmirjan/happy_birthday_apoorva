        <p class="first"><b>Laughter, they say, is the best medicine. Apoorva, your laughter is not just laughter; it's a symphony of happiness that reverberates through the hearts of those fortunate enough to know you. Your laughter is the kind that can illuminate the darkest of days and make even the most somber moments radiant. It's an enchanting melody, a source of pure, unadulterated joy. On this extraordinary day, as we celebrate your birth, may your laughter echo through the universe, filling every corner of your world with the music of mirth and laughter. Let it be a reminder to us all that joy can be found in the simplest of things, and that your laughter, Apoorva, is a treasure that enriches our lives every day.</b></p>
